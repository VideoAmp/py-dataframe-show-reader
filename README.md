# py-dataframe-show-reader

``py-dataframe-show-reader`` is a library that reads the output of an Apache
Spark DataFrame.show() statement into a PySpark DataFrame.

The primary intended use of the functions in this library is to be used to
enable writing more concise and easy-to-read tests of data transformations than
would otherwise be possible.

Imagine we are working on a Python method that uses PySpark to perform a data
transformation that is not terribly complex, but complex enough that we would
like to verify that it performs as intended. For example, consider this
function that accepts a PySpark Dataframe containing daily sales figures and
returns a Dataframe containing weekly sales summaries:

```python
def summarize_weekly_sales(df_to_average: DataFrame):
    return (df_to_average
            .groupby(f.weekofyear('date').alias('week_of_year'))
            .agg(f.avg('units_sold').alias('avg_units_sold'),
                 f.sum('gross_sales').alias('gross_sales')))
```

This is not a complex method, but perhaps we would like to verify that:

1. Dates are in fact grouped into different weeks.
1. Units sold are actually averaged and not summed.
1. Gross sales are truly summed and not averaged.

A unit testing purist might argue that each of these assertions should be
covered by a separate test method, but there are at least two reasons why one
might choose not to do that.

1. Practical experience tells us that detectable overhead is incurred for
each separate PySpark transformation test, so we may want to limit the number
of separate tests in order to keep our full test suite running in a
reasonable duration.

1. When working with data sets as we do in Spark or SQL, particularly when
using aggregate, grouping and window functions,
interactions between different rows can be easy to overlook. Tweaking a
query to fix an aggregate function like a summation might inadvertently break
the intended behavior of a windowing function in the query.
A change to the query might allow a summation-only unit test to pass while leaving broken
window function behavior undetected because we have neglected to  update
the window-function-only unit test.  

If we accept that we'd like to use a single test to verify the three
requirements of our query, we need three rows in our input DataFrame.

Using unadorned pytest, our test might look like this:

```python
def test_without_dataframe_show_reader(spark_session: SparkSession):
    input_rows = [
        Row(
            date=datetime(2019, 1, 1),
            units_sold=10,
            gross_sales=100,
        ),
        Row(
            date=datetime(2019, 1, 2),
            units_sold=20,
            gross_sales=200,
        ),
        Row(
            date=datetime(2019, 1, 8),
            units_sold=80,
            gross_sales=800,
        ),
    ]
    input_df = spark_session.createDataFrame(input_rows)

    result = summarize_weekly_sales(input_df).collect()

    assert 2 == len(result)  # Number of rows
    assert 3 == len(result[0])  # Number of columns
    assert 1 == result[0]['week_of_year']
    assert 15 == result[0]['avg_units_sold']
    assert 300 == result[0]['gross_sales']
    assert 2 == result[1]['week_of_year']
    assert 80 == result[1]['avg_units_sold']
    assert 800 == result[1]['gross_sales']
```

Using the DataFrame Show Reader, our test could instead look like this:

```python
def test_using_dataframe_show_reader(spark_session: SparkSession):
    input_df = show_output_to_df("""
    +-------------------+----------+-----------+
    |date               |units_sold|gross_sales|
    +-------------------+----------+-----------+
    |2019-01-01 00:00:00|10        |100        |
    |2019-01-02 00:00:00|20        |200        |
    |2019-01-08 00:00:00|80        |800        | This date is in week 2.
    +-------------------+----------+-----------+
    """, spark_session)

    expected_df = show_output_to_df("""
    +------------+--------------+-----------+
    |week_of_year|avg_units_sold|gross_sales|
    [int         |double        |double     ]
    +------------+--------------+-----------+
    |1           |15            |300        |
    |2           |80            |800        |
    +------------+--------------+-----------+
    """, spark_session)

    assert_equal(expected_df, summarize_weekly_sales(input_df))
```

In the second test example, the ``show_output_to_df`` function accepts as input
a string containing the output of a Spark DataFrame.show() call and
"rehydrates" it into a new Spark DataFrame instance that can be used for
testing.

In the first version, the setup portion of the test contains eighteen lines,
and it may take a few moments to digest the contents of the input rows.
In the second version, the setup portion contains nine lines and displays the
input data in a more concise tabular form that may be easier for other
programmers (and our future selves) to digest when we need to maintain this
code down the road.

If the method under test was more complicated and required more rows and/or
columns in order to adequately test, the length of the first test format would
grow much more quickly than that of the test using the DataFrame Show Reader.

Notice also that the ``show_output_to_df`` function gives us a convenient way
to create an ``expected_df`` to pass to the ``assert_equal`` function (to check
DataFrame equality )that is included in the package. In addition to allowing
this compact display of the expected numbers of rows and columns and data,
``assert_equal`` checks that the DataFrame schemas match, which the first
version of the test does not do.
